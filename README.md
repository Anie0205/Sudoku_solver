# Sudoku Solver in C++ with Backtracking

This project implements a Sudoku solver in C++ using the backtracking algorithm, a fundamental concept from Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Overview

The Sudoku solver is designed to efficiently find solutions for Sudoku puzzles by employing a backtracking approach. It systematically fills empty cells with values that adhere to the game's constraints until a solution is found or proven impossible.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Utilizes the backtracking technique to solve Sudoku puzzles.
- **Efficient Solution:** Provides an efficient method to solve a wide range of Sudoku difficulties.
- **Clear Demonstration:** Demonstrates the application of backtracking in solving Sudoku puzzles.

## Usage

To use the Sudoku solver:
- Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
- Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
- Run the compiled executable and input the Sudoku puzzle to solve.

## Python Sudoku Generator Script

This repository includes a Python script that generates random Sudoku puzzles.

### Features of the Python Script

- **Puzzle Generation:** Generates random Sudoku puzzles.
- **Customization:** Allows customization of the size of the puzzle (e.g., 9x9 grid).
- **Ease of Use:** Provides a simple script to generate Sudoku puzzles using Python.

### Usage of the Python Script

To utilize the Python Sudoku generator script:
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Run the script using the command: `python sudoku_generator.py`.
- Follow the prompts or modify the script directly to adjust puzzle sizes.

Feel free to explore the generated puzzles with the C++ solver or any other Sudoku-solving approach.
